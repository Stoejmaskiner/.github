# St√∏jmaskiner

*St√∏jmaskiner* makes open source [VST3/CLAP](../../../all-plugins) plugins, [free sample packs](https://stoej.gumroad.com) and other random stuff.

St√∏jmaskiner is run by a single person right now, [Lorenzo Panieri](https://github.com/PanieriLorenzo), but contributions are welcome! Feel free to reach out if you are interested in working toghether. I'm also (sometimes) active on Discord in the [Rust-Audio](https://rust.audio/) server.

My objective is to build simplistic, yet highly efficient and usable tools for music making. All my code is open source, under [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit/) or [GPLv3](https://opensource.org/license/gpl-3-0/) licenses. I'm not currently a business, I just make stuff for fun. If you really want to pay me, you can get one of my [(free) sample packs](https://stoej.gumroad.com) with "pay what you want", or [buy some of my music](https://xydamage.bandcamp.com/).

## What does *St√∏jmaskiner* mean?

*St√∏jmaskiner* is Danish for "noise machines". You will occasionally see it spelled *Stoejmaskiner*, in places where ASCII compatibility might be preferred, such as URLs and code. Both spellings are correct, but please don't spell it *Stojmaskiner* üòâ.

## I want to contribute, what do I do?

You can contribute in a variety of ways:
- Submit an issue on one of my plugins to report bugs or ask for features
- Submit an issue on the [*all-plugins*](../../../all-plugins) page to submit plugin ideas or governance issues
- Fork one of my plugins to resolve an issue and open a pull request. You probably need to be familiar with the [Rust]() programming language and the [NIH-plug]() framework.

For bugs related to [FunDSP](https://github.com/SamiPerttu/fundsp), [NIH-plug](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug) or [Vizia](https://github.com/vizia/vizia), refer to their respective repositories and their contribution policies.
