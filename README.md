# St√∏jmaskiner

*St√∏jmaskiner* makes open source [VST3/CLAP](../../../all-plugins) plugins and [free sample packs](https://stoej.gumroad.com).

St√∏jmaskiner is run by a single person right now, [Lorenzo Panieri](https://github.com/PanieriLorenzo), but contributions are welcome! Feel free to reach out if you are interested in working toghether. I'm also (sometimes) active on Discord in the [Rust-Audio](https://rust.audio/) server.

My objective is to build simplistic, yet highly efficient and usable tools for music making. All my code is open source, under MIT or GPLv3 licenses. I'm not currently a business, I just make stuff for fun. If you really want to pay me, you can get one of my [(free) sample packs](https://stoej.gumroad.com) with "pay what you want".

## What does *St√∏jmaskiner* mean?

*St√∏jmaskiner* is Danish for "noise machines". You will occasionally see it spelled *Stoejmaskiner*, in places where ASCII compatibility might be preferred, such as URLs and code. Both spellings are correct, but please don't spell it *Stojmaskiner* üòâ.
